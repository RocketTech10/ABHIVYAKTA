# SAR Image Colorization

## Using Adaptive Fusion Model

**SAR Image Colorization** focuses on enhancing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images by adding color to them. The project utilizes an **Adaptive Fusion Model** to achieve high-quality colorization that preserves the structural and textural details of SAR images.

### Description and Flowchart

Below is a flowchart illustrating the process of SAR image colorization using the Adaptive Fusion Model, displayed next to the description:

| Flowchart | Description |

Colorizing these images can significantly improve interpretability and analysis. The Adaptive Fusion Model leverages advanced machine learning techniques to effectively integrate multi-source information, ensuring that the colorization process maintains the integrity of the original SAR data while enhancing its visual representation. <br><br> The model adapts to different SAR image characteristics and environmental conditions by dynamically adjusting the fusion strategy. This adaptive approach allows for improved accuracy and better visual results compared to static methods. |
